Book Summary:
<br />
Through the last 20 years of my journey as an educator in the field of Engineering/Medical Entrance Exams preparation. I have come across every possible doubt, confusion and question that a student can have. It is with an aim to address each and every concern of my dear students who are preparing for NEET Exam, that this book has been designed.
<br />
The major concern of the students is how the questions will be framed to judge their indepth knowledge of subject. This book covers the various ways in which problems can be put across. One of the unique features of this book is that it takes you from a comfortable level to a challenging level in a way that you glide through it all while grasping each topic at the same time.
<br />
Level of problems in this book is slightly higher than generally asked in medical entrance exams. This is done intentionally so that after solving this book thoroughly, students gain confidence that they can easily crack physics problems asked in medical entrance exams. This book is intended to be your guide in journey of understanding and loving physics.
